              <div class="text1"><h1> Eiffel Tower</h1>
                French Tour Eiffel, Parisian landmark that is also a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. When
                the French government was organizing the International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, a competition 
                was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted, and the Centennial Committee accepted that of the noted bridge
                 engineer Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel's concept of a 300-metre (984-foot) tower built almost entirely of open-lattice wrought iron aroused amazement, 
                 skepticism,
                and no little 
                opposition on aesthetic grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.The tower itself is 300 metres (984 feet) 
                high. It rests on a base that is 5 metres (17 feet) high, and 
                a television antenna atop the tower gives it a total elevation of 324 metres (1,063 feet). The Eiffel Tower was the tallest
                 structure in the world until the topping off of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1929. </div>

                 709. Since it's completion it has become an important religious and educational site. Visitors can tour the church and

                The Temple of Osiris in Abydos is one of Ancient Egypt's most fascinating artistic treasures. Its hypostyle halls, graced by papyrus-
                headed columns, contain some of the finest relief-work in Egypt, with various scenes portraying the pharaoh and the gods of Ancient Egypt. The 
                temple of Seti I has an unusual
                 L-shaped ground plan and was built primarily of limestone, with the occasional use of sandstone in different areas throughout the 
                 structure. The inscribed labels also indicate that Egyptian writing had reached an advanced stage earlier than was generally recognized. In 
                 addition, several 
                 large-scale mud-brick enclosures located near the desert's edge were identified as funerary sites for the kings of the1st
                 (c. 2925-c. 2775 BCE) and 2nd (c. 2775 - c. 2650 BCE) dynasties. A series of wooden boats covered by whitewashed mud-brick casings—probably 
                 prototypes for the boats
                   buried in pits next to the pyramids of the Old Kingdom (c. 2575 - c. 2130 BCE)—were discovered alongside one of the enclosures. </div>

                Pyramids built during a time when Egypt was one of the richest and most powerful civilizations in the world, the pyramids—especially
                the Great Pyramids of Giza—are some of the most magnificent man-made structures in history.
                Their massive scale reflects the unique role that the pharaoh, or king, played in ancient Egyptian society. The pyramids became the focus of a
                 cult of the dead king that was supposed to continue well after his death. No pyramids are more celebrated than the Great Pyramids of Giza, located on 
                  a plateau on the west bank of the Nile River, on the outskirts of modern-day Cairo. The last of the great pyramid builders was Pepy II
                   (2278-2184 B.C.),
                   the second king of the sixth dynasty, who came to power as a young boy and ruled for 94 years. Nowadays millions of people continue to visit 
                   the pyramids 
                   each year, drawn by their towering grandeur and the enduring allure of Egypt's rich and glorious past.</div>

                    Kandy is where you go to learn about and experience Sri Lankan history. Located in central Sri Lanka, the city is the former capital city 
                    of the Sri Lankan royal 
                    dynasty, the country's main capital before the colonial period. The high point of what's called the "Kandian Era" 
                    was between the 15th and 18th centuries, when the area remained independent while most of the coastal regions were colonized by European powers.
                    Be sure to visit the city's National Museum of Kandy, as it illustrates the story of the region and its people via exhibits and artifacts.
                     Nearby, the Temple of 
                    the Sacred Tooth Relic is a very holy Buddhist shrine, part of the royal palace complex. Kandy Lake is at the heart of the city and offers
                     a peaceful refuge from
                     the heat. There are hiking paths that circle the lake, dotted with temples and shrines.
                    Kandy is surrounded by mountains, which are home to many tea plantations. Some can be visited and offer tours and tea tastings.
                     It's also surrounded by rainforests. 
                    The Udawatta Kele Sanctuary is a forest park located within the city limits. The forest reserve has miles of hiking trails, as well as
                     an excellent nature center

                    environment vary, as the park is on the border of the country's wet and dry zones.
                    Visitors to the park can see elephants, as there's a large population of them, along with crocodiles, water buffalo, and more. In fact, it's
                    one of the best places in the world to see elephants in the wild outside of Africa.
                    There are leopards there, too, but they can be very hard to track or spot. There are also monkeys and a large assortment of deer and small
                     mammals. It's also an excellent place for bird-watching.
                    There are some small accommodations and guesthouses across from and even inside Udawalawe. You can also visit as a day trip, the best times
                    to visit are very early in the morning or very late in the afternoon.
